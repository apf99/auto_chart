Image Analysis Algorithm for Curve Intersection Detection
Purpose and Scope:
Analyze chart images to detect intersections between curves.
Designed to handle charts with any number of curves, not limited to two.
Capable of processing various types of chart images with different complexities.
Preprocessing and Image Preparation:
a) Image Conversion:
Loads the original image file (e.g., 'Chart_Image_1.jpg').
Converts the image to grayscale for easier processing.
b) Noise Reduction:
Applies Gaussian blur to reduce noise and smooth the image.
c) Adaptive Thresholding:
Uses adaptive thresholding to create a binary image.
This process separates curves from background, gridlines, and axis labels.
Effectively removes lighter elements like gridlines and text.
d) Contour Detection and Filtering:
Finds contours in the binary image.
Filters contours based on:
Length: Removes very short contours (noise or artifacts).
Area: Eliminates contours too small to be part of main curves.
Proximity to edges: Excludes likely axis labels or border elements.
e) Clean Bitmap Creation:
Draws filtered contours on a new white background.
Results in a clean bitmap containing only relevant curve data.
3. Initialization Process:
a) Starting Point Identification:
Locates and marks the starting points of each curve.
b) Curve Count Determination:
Sets the expected number of groups based on starting points.
c) Initial Thickness Calculation:
Samples multiple columns from leftmost starting point to rightmost ending point.
Takes 10 samples across this range.
Calculates average thickness where group count matches expected count.
d) Minimum Height Threshold:
Sets minimum height for valid pixel groups (25% of initial thickness).
Main Analysis Process (Column-by-Column):
a) Pixel Group Identification:
Analyzes each column of the bitmap from left to right.
Identifies contiguous sets of black pixels (pixel groups).
Ignores groups smaller than the minimum height threshold.
b) Group Legitimacy Check:
Ensures number of groups never exceeds number of starting points.
Legitimate group criteria:
Connected to a group in the previous column (top, bottom, or middle pixel), OR
Connected to a starting point in the previous column (any pixel can be adjacent).
Groups not meeting these criteria are considered bogus.
c) Bogus Group Handling:
"Disregards" bogus groups by changing their pixels to white.
This cleaning occurs in real-time during analysis.
Intersection Detection:
a) Start of Intersection Criteria:
Number of groups decreases.
At least one group becomes significantly taller (1.8 times average height).
b) End of Intersection Criteria:
Number of groups increases back to more than one.
Maximum group height falls below 1.5 times the initial thickness.
c) Marking Intersections:
Start of intersection marked with a black vertical line.
End of intersection marked with a magenta vertical line.
6. Challenges and Considerations:
a) Artifact Handling:
Text or other artifacts can create bogus groups.
Bogus groups may merge with legitimate groups, complicating removal.
b) False Positives:
Algorithm may detect false intersections due to artifacts (e.g., 'b' artifact in the example).
c) Merged Bogus and Legitimate Groups:
Difficulty in separating bogus elements that have merged with legitimate curves.
Key Principles and Rules:
Group count never exceeds starting point count.
Real-time cleaning of bogus groups is essential.
Careful tracking of group continuity and legitimacy throughout the process.
Adaptive thresholding based on initial curve characteristics.
Minimum size threshold for valid pixel groups to filter out noise.
Current Limitations and Areas for Improvement:
Refining the algorithm to better distinguish between actual intersections and artifacts.
Developing methods to handle bogus groups that merge with legitimate groups.
Improving robustness against various types of chart artifacts and imperfections.
9. Implementation Details:
Uses OpenCV library for image processing tasks.
Implements custom functions for pixel group identification and legitimacy checking.
Utilizes dynamic thresholding to adapt to different chart styles and qualities.
Output and Visualization:
Produces a final image with intersections marked.
Draws colored circles to indicate starting and ending points of curves.
Visualizes the detection process for easy verification and debugging.
This comprehensive summary encapsulates the entire process, from initial image processing to final intersection detection, including the challenges faced and the strategies employed to overcome them. It provides a detailed overview of the algorithm's functionality, its underlying principles, and the current areas of focus for improvement.
