The Reverse Pass Process:
The reverse pass is a crucial part of our image processing algorithm, designed to refine and validate the curve detection performed in the forward pass. It starts from the rightmost end of the image and moves towards the left, analyzing each column of pixels.
Initialization:
right_x: The x-coordinate of the rightmost end point.
left_x: The x-coordinate of the leftmost start point.
avg_heights_backward: Initialized with the ending thicknesses from the forward pass.
prev_groups: An initially empty list that will store the groups from the previous column.
break_column: Initially set to None, this will store the column where the process breaks if an issue is detected.
initial_thickness: Calculated using the initialize_curve_thicknesses function, which samples multiple points between the rightmost start point and leftmost end point to get an average thickness.
Main Loop:
The core of the reverse pass is a for loop that iterates from right_x to left_x - 1, moving from right to left across the image. For each column x, it performs the following steps:
Group Identification:
Calls the identify_pixel_groups function, which returns:
group_count: The number of groups identified.
groups: All identified groups.
filtered_groups: Groups that passed the secondary filter.
Excess Group Check:
Checks if the number of filtered groups exceeds the number of start points. If so:
Logs the column number and details of all groups.
Sets the break_column to the current x.
Breaks the loop, ending the reverse pass early.
Intersection Detection:
Checks for the start of an intersection by comparing the current group count to the previous group count and examining the heights of the groups.
Height Averaging:
If not in an intersection and the number of filtered groups matches the number of start points, it updates the running averages of the curve heights.
Group Update:
Sets prev_groups to the current filtered_groups for the next iteration.
Secondary Filtering:
The secondary filter compares each group in the current column to the groups in the previous column, checking for overlap. This helps maintain continuity and eliminates spurious groups.
Group Elimination:
When a group is eliminated by the secondary filter, it's immediately erased from the bitmap. This is done by setting the corresponding pixels in the bitmap to white (255). This real-time update ensures that eliminated groups don't influence future iterations or intersect with other curves incorrectly.
Intersection Handling:
When an intersection is detected:
The algorithm doesn't update the running averages of curve heights within the intersection.
The secondary filter becomes more lenient, allowing for the possibility of curves merging or splitting.
Intersection boundaries are marked (intersection_starts and intersection_ends) for later visualization.
The algorithm may allow for a temporary increase in the number of groups to account for curve crossings.
Adaptive Filtering:
The secondary filter's behavior adapts based on whether it's in an intersection or not:
Outside intersections, it's stricter to maintain curve continuity.
Inside intersections, it's more lenient to allow for curve merging and splitting.
Start and End Point Preservation:
Groups containing start or end points are always preserved, regardless of other filtering criteria. This ensures that the key points of each curve are maintained throughout the process.
Bitmap Consistency Check:
After each column is processed, there's a check to ensure the number of black pixel groups in the bitmap matches the number of filtered groups. This serves as a validation step to catch any discrepancies between the group data and the bitmap representation.
Dynamic Minimum Height Adjustment:
The minimum height for group identification is continuously adjusted based on a percentage (usually 60%) of the current moving average height. This allows the algorithm to adapt to gradually changing curve thicknesses.
Group Continuity Across Columns:
The algorithm attempts to maintain group continuity from one column to the next using the prev_groups information to inform decisions about current groups. This helps in tracing continuous curves even when they change direction or thickness.
Final Image Creation:
After the reverse pass:
1. Creates a new image (contour_img_updated) with the refined contours.
Redraws the start and end points as colored circles (orange for start, cyan for end).
Draws intersection lines in black (left side) and magenta (right side).
If a break_column was set, it draws a blue line at that column.
The final image is then saved and displayed, including all annotations.
Key Challenges and Nuances:
1. Balancing sensitivity in the secondary filter.
Accurate intersection detection and handling.
Maintaining group continuity across columns.
4. Immediate bitmap updates for eliminated groups.
Adapting to varying curve thicknesses and chart types.
Additional Important Details:
1. Bitmap Representation: Binary representation where 0 represents curve pixels and 255 represents background.
Group Structure: Each group is a tuple (start_y, end_y, height).
Extensive logging and debugging, especially around problematic areas.
Error handling for potential issues like failure to initialize curve thicknesses.
Performance optimization using numpy operations and efficient looping structures.
Flexibility to handle varying numbers of curves and complex intersections.
Memory management through in-place bitmap modifications.
