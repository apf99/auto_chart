Comprehensive Overview of Anomaly Detection, Curve Smoothing, and Curve Tracing
1. Anomaly Detection:
The anomaly detection process is designed to identify and mark regions in the analyzed curves where significant deviations from the expected curve behavior occur. This process is implemented as a separate pass after the initial forward and reverse passes for curve and intersection detection.
Key components of the anomaly detection process:
a. Initialization:
is_anomaly: A boolean flag to track if we're currently in an anomalous region.
anomaly_start_columns: A list to store the starting columns of detected anomalies.
anomaly_end_columns: A list to store the ending columns of detected anomalies.
running_avg_heights: Initialized with the final avg_heights_backward from the reverse pass.
b. Iteration Process:
The algorithm iterates through each column of the image from left to right, starting from the leftmost starting point to the rightmost ending point.
c. Group Identification:
For each column, the identify_pixel_groups function is called to determine the pixel groups present. This function returns the group count and details of each group (start y, end y, height).
d. Anomaly Detection Criteria:
Start of anomaly: Current height > 1.8 running average height
End of anomaly: Current height returns to within 20% of pre-anomaly average
e. Anomaly Tracking:
When an anomaly starts, the column number is added to anomaly_start_columns.
When an anomaly ends, the column number is added to anomaly_end_columns.
The is_anomaly flag is used to track whether we're currently within an anomalous region.
f. Running Average Update:
The running average heights are updated using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) approach.
Updates are skipped in intersection regions and for starting points.
g. Visualization:
Blue vertical lines are drawn at the start of each anomalous region.
Green vertical lines are drawn at the end of each anomalous region.
These lines are added to the contour_img_updated image.
h. Challenges and Considerations:
Balancing sensitivity: The thresholds (1.8 for start, 20% for end) are crucial for accurate detection.
Handling intersections: Special care is taken to not update averages in these regions.
Starting point exclusion: Vital for maintaining accurate running averages.
Continuous processing: The algorithm doesn't break after finding one anomaly, allowing for multiple detections.
Curve Smoothing:
The curve smoothing process is implemented to address anomalies detected in the curves, particularly focusing on smoothing out artifacts or irregularities that may have been introduced during the image processing or curve detection stages.
Key aspects of the curve smoothing process:
a. Initialization:
The process begins after the anomaly detection pass.
It focuses on the regions identified as anomalous.
b. Gradient Calculation:
For each anomalous region, a gradient is calculated using two columns before the anomaly starts.
The gradient is calculated separately for the top and bottom of the curve.
c. Linear Interpolation:
Using the calculated gradient, the algorithm predicts where the curve should be in each column of the anomalous region.
This prediction is based on linear interpolation from the last known good point before the anomaly.
d. Pixel Modification:
The bitmap is modified based on the predicted curve position.
Pixels outside the predicted range are changed to white (background).
Pixels within the predicted range are left unchanged (black, part of the curve).
e. Group Handling:
The algorithm works with the concept of pixel groups, which represent continuous segments of the curve in each column.
It identifies the anomalous group in each column and applies smoothing to this specific group.
f. Smoothing Process:
For each column in the anomalous region:
Calculate the predicted top and bottom y-coordinates based on the gradient.
Compare the predicted position with the actual position of the curve.
Modify pixels to align the actual curve more closely with the predicted position.
g. Logging and Debugging:
Detailed logging is implemented to track the smoothing process.
Information about predicted vs. actual group positions and the number of pixels changed is recorded.
h. Challenges and Considerations:
Balancing smoothing with preserving legitimate curve features.
Handling cases where the anomaly significantly deviates from the expected trajectory.
Ensuring smooth transitions at the start and end of anomalous regions.
Curve Tracing:
The curve tracing process is designed to follow and reconstruct the path of each curve in the image, taking into account intersections and potential anomalies.
Key components of the curve tracing process:
a. Initialization:
Starts from a given start point (typically from the start_points list).
Initializes an empty curve list to store the traced points.
b. Group Identification:
Uses the identify_pixel_groups function to find the initial group containing the start point.
c. Main Tracing Loop:
Iterates through columns from left to right.
For each column, it identifies the connected group in the next column.
d. Normal Tracing:
In non-intersection regions, it finds the middle point of the connected group and adds it to the curve.
e. Intersection Handling:
Detects when the curve enters an intersection region.
Uses a prediction mechanism to trace through the intersection:
Calculates gradients based on the curve's behavior before the intersection.
Predicts the curve's path through the intersection using these gradients.
Adds predicted points to the curve.
f. Post-Intersection Continuation:
After predicting through the intersection, it resumes normal tracing.
Finds the group in the column immediately after the last predicted point.
Continues tracing from this point.
g. Termination Conditions:
Stops tracing if it reaches an end point or the edge of the image.
Also terminates if no connected group is found in the next column.
h. Challenges and Considerations:
Accurately predicting curve paths through intersections.
Handling cases where curves change direction or thickness significantly.
Dealing with potential artifacts or anomalies that might disrupt the tracing process.
i. Integration with Anomaly Detection and Smoothing:
The tracing process needs to work in conjunction with the anomaly detection and smoothing processes.
It should be able to trace smoothed curves accurately and handle regions that have been modified.
j. Performance Optimization:
Efficient group identification and connection checking are crucial for performance.
The algorithm aims to minimize redundant calculations and optimize memory usage.
This comprehensive overview covers the intricate details of the anomaly detection, curve smoothing, and curve tracing processes. It highlights the algorithms' sophistication in dealing with complex curve structures, intersections, and anomalies while maintaining efficiency and accuracy. The processes are designed to work together to provide a robust solution for analyzing and reconstructing curves in chart images, handling various challenges such as intersections, artifacts, and irregularities in the curve data.
